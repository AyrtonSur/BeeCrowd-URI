# BeeCrowd-URI
Here are some beecrowds codes that i think may be useful for people that could not solve these problems.

Every single one of these codes were made in python, mainly because when I was solving these problems I had just started university and had just learned python.
Most codes are pretty hard to understand, not because they are hard to program but because they were poorly written, so, sorry about that.
